#### Before Debug ####
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.") 
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")') 
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.") 



#### After Fix Line ####

# printing string must used quotes on head and tail sentences. double or single quotes is doesn't matter.
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

# if want to use different type of quotes, make sure single quotes and double quotes is correct.
print("String Concatenation is done with the '+' sign.")

# identation or tab is not neccessary on this line
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# excess of parenthesis on head string
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")



#### Testing based on that's above information ^^^ ####
print("Hello " + "World \n")
print("Hello " + "World \n")
print("Hello " + "World \n")
