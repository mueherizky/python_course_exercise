#### Before Debug ####
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation") ---> printing string must used quotes on head and tail sentences. double or single quotes is doesn't matter.
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.") ---> if want use different type of quotes, make sure single quotes and double quotes is correct
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")') ---> identation or tab is not neccessary on this line
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.") ---> excess of brackets/paranthesis on head string

#### After Fix Line ####
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the '+' sign.")
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

#### Testing based on that's above information ^^^ ####
print("Hello " + "World \n")
print("Hello " + "World \n")
print("Hello " + "World \n")
